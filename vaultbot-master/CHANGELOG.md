## [Unreleased]

## [1.13.0] - 2022-04-22

### Added

- gcp and agent auth methods (see [!50](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/merge_requests/50), thanks a lot to [bhoriuchi](https://gitlab.com/bhoriuchi) for the MR üëè)

### Fixed

- fixed an issue where rpm / deb builds can have insecure permissions

## [1.12.0] - 2021-07-07

### Added

- switched to goreleaser for releasing artifacts
- `rpm` and `deb` builds

## [1.11.1] - 2021-04-05

### Fixed

- do not log error message when no logfile option has been specified (see [#38](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/38))
- change default logfile permissions from `0666` to `0600`
- reduce token usage to 1 by only checking the authentication token when it is anyways not used in the current run  (see [#35](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/35))

## [1.11.0] - 2021-03-14

### Fixed

- bumped golang to 1.16
- bumped module dependencies to latest minor version
- bumped vault/api to v1.0.5
- bigger internal refactoring to make code more habitable

## [1.10.1] - 2021-02-18

### Fixed

- incorrect parsing of PKCS12 umask (see [#33](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/33))

## [1.10.0] - 2021-01-03

### Added

- bumped golang to 1.15
- added support for managing PKCS#12 certificates (see [#27](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/27), thanks a lot to [DejfCold](https://gitlab.com/DejfCold) for the MR üëè)
- bumped docker base image to latest alpine

## [1.9.1] - 2020-07-05

### Added

- bumped golang to 1.14
- added multi-arch docker builds for arm64 (see [#29](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/29))

## [1.9.0] - 2020-03-06

### Deprecated

- option `--pki_jks_export` will be removed in a future release. Determining certificate export to JKS is now done based on whether `--pki_jks_path` is specified

### Changed

- option `--pki_cert_path` no longer has any default value specified. This allows us to determine whether certificates should be exported to file, jks or both

### Added

- it is now possible to export certificates to either file, java key store or both. Whether certificates should be exported to either of those locations is determined based on wether the flags `--pki_cert_path` and / or `--pki_jks_path` have been specified (see [#28](https://gitlab.com/msvechla/vaultbot/issues/28))

## [1.8.3] - 2020-01-07
